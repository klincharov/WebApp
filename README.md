PROJECT 2: Show .jpg files

DESCRIPTION:
Given is a database that contains several records concerning different people. Each record consists of two fields: a name and a number. You can add any other fields that could facilitate the work.  Each record is connected with a .jpg-file by means of the number. 
Example: 
	Record:	Ivan Stefanov;	28809
			The corresponding file is 28809.jpg and contains an image.

	Record:	Rosen Rashev;	33076
			The corresponding file is 33076.jpg and contains an image.
	
When the application starts, it displays on the screen the table, consisting of names and corresponding numbers. 
When the text is displayed on the screen, users can read it, scrolling up and down and using the mouse.
When the user clicks by the mouse on a given name, a popup window should appear, in which the image, contained in the respective file should be shown.

REALISATION:
Choose all necessary tools at your will and preferences.

BONUS POINTS:
1. To add in the definition data base an additional field for each name, which should count how many times this name has been clicked (and the corresponding image displayed).

2. To develop and implement a functionality for adding/updating/deleting NUMBER elements in the table.
